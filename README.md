# Drill String Designing and Safety Assessment

## Overview

This repository contains tools and methodologies for designing and assessing the safety of drill strings used in drilling operations. The focus is on evaluating the safety of each section under normal design conditions and factoring in various safety parameters.

## Key Parameters

- AWOB (Allowable Weight on Bit)
- AMOP (Allowable Maximum Operating Pressure)
- ASFT (Allowable Safety Factor)
- ANc (Allowable Design Factor for Collapse)
- ANi (Allowable Design Factor for Burst)
